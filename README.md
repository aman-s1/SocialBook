## Technologies Used
  -HTML

## API Used
  -Font Awesome(To get some icons like map locator & arrow icon)

## Main Steps to create these pages
  *First we will create our index.html file and style.css file.
  *Then we will add navigation bar to top of it having our logo and some more icons in left and in right we will add search bar and profile photo to it.
  *Then we will divide the page into three parts- left sidebar , mid-content and right sidebar.
  *We will create left and right sidebar sticky so that when we scroll our webpage left and right sidebar do not get scrolled.
  *Then we will add images and text to left sidebar and we will style those elements in css file.
  *And in right sidebar we have added events list and online list. In event list I have got map locator icon from Font Awesome API.
  *Then we will come to our mid-content and add images like status .
  *After that we will add Post Container for writing post.
  *Below that we will add posts to fill our webpage.
  *In next step , we will add onclick dropdown menu to user icon in top left corner.
  *In that menu we will add dark theme button.
  *We will add dark theme functionality in javaScript file script.js.
  *And we will add our next page i.e. profile page in that dropdown menu.
  *We will add same nav to our profile page and add same dropdown menu.
  *And in nav bar we will add our index page link to logo.
  *Then we will add user image and user data in profile page.
  *We will divide this page to two parts left for images and friends and right part for posts.
  *We will add same post conatiner and those posts to fill out web page.
